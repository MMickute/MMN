                <p>Paul Baran (1926-2011) was a Polish-American engineer who invented several technologies related to network architecture. His work on centralized vs decentralized architecture, during the cold war, was inspired by the need to design a network that could withstand a nuclear attack. (More)</p>
                <p>One of such labels is that of the federated network, a term often mentioned when talking about the architecture of (alternative) social networks such as Diaspora or Lorea. What is a federated network, though? The word itself hints at similarities with the political concept of a federation (see further on), but how such a state architecture would be applicable to networks is not immediately clear. In this essay, I will take a closer look at this term and how it fits in the network architecture discourse.</p>
                <p>As mentioned before, Paul Baran in his classic 1964 text On distributed communication networks distinguishes three kinds of architectures that would be applicable to communication networks. As this text is often cited when discussing network architectures, it is a good place to start with an exploration of network architecture terminology. Baran envisions a network as an interconnected set of nodes, agents that can send and receive data. These nodes can then be organized in various ways, and this organization is what distinguishes the types of network architecture from each other.</p>
